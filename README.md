## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html**:
   - This is the main HTML file that serves as the user interface for the application.
   - It contains HTML elements for displaying questions, answers, and any other necessary components such as a search bar or navigation menu.

- **about.html**:
   - This optional HTML file can provide additional information about the application, its purpose, and its features.
   - It may include static text, images, or links to external resources.

### Routes

- **index**:
   - This route handles the main page of the application by rendering the `index.html` template.
   - It can also handle form submissions for searching questions.

- **answer**:
   - This route processes search queries and generates answers using Gemini LLM.
   - It collects the user's question from a form or API request, sends it to the Gemini LLM service, and displays the response in the `index.html` template.

- **about**:
   - This route handles requests for the about page, rendering the `about.html` template.
   - It is optional and depends on whether the application includes an about page.
